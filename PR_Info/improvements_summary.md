# Summary of Script Improvements

## Changes Applied to All Three Scripts

### 1. Repository Validation
Added git repository check at the beginning of each script:
```batch
REM Check if we're in a git repository
git rev-parse --git-dir >nul 2>&1
if %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 (
    echo Error: Not in a git repository
    exit /b 1
)
```

### 2. Configurable/Auto-Detected Branch Names
For `pr_review.bat` and `pr_summary.bat`, added intelligent branch detection:
- First checks if `BASE_BRANCH` environment variable is set
- If not, attempts to detect the default branch from origin's HEAD
- Falls back to checking for `main` or `master` branches
- Provides clear error message if detection fails

Users can now:
- Set `BASE_BRANCH` environment variable for custom branches
- Or rely on automatic detection

### 3. Unique Temporary File Names
Changed from fixed temp file names to unique names using:
```batch
set TEMP_FILE=%TEMP%\[script_name]_%RANDOM%_%TIME:~6,2%%TIME:~9,2%.txt
```
This prevents collisions when scripts run in parallel.

### 4. Additional Improvements

#### For pr_review.bat and pr_summary.bat:
- Added file size checking with warning for large diffs (>500KB)
- Better error handling with temporary file approach
- User feedback showing which base branch is being used

#### For pr_summary.bat:
- Added check and creation of PR_Info folder if it doesn't exist

## Benefits
- **Safer**: Validates git repository before running commands
- **More Flexible**: Works with different default branch names
- **More Robust**: Prevents temp file collisions
- **Better UX**: Provides clear feedback and warnings
- **Production Ready**: Proper error handling throughout

## Usage Examples
```batch
REM Use with custom base branch
set BASE_BRANCH=develop
pr_review.bat

REM Auto-detect branch (will use main, master, or origin's HEAD)
pr_review.bat
```
