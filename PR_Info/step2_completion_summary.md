# Step 2 Completion Summary: Server Integration

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## What Was Done

### 1. Added Imports ✅
- Added `from src.code_checker_mypy import MypyResult, get_mypy_prompt` to server.py imports

### 2. Added Helper Method ✅
- Created `_format_mypy_result` method to format mypy check results consistently
- Follows the same pattern as existing `_format_pylint_result` and `_format_pytest_result`

### 3. Added Mypy Tool Method ✅
- Implemented `run_mypy_check` as an MCP tool with:
  - Comprehensive docstring with parameter descriptions
  - Support for all key mypy options (strict, disable_error_codes, target_directories, follow_imports, cache_dir)
  - Proper logging with both standard and structured loggers
  - Error handling with try/except blocks
  - Formatted output for LLM consumption

### 4. Updated run_all_checks Method ✅
- Added mypy parameters to method signature:
  - `mypy_strict: bool = True`
  - `mypy_disable_codes: list[str] | None = None`
- Integrated mypy execution into the flow
- Updated result formatting to include mypy results as item #3
- Updated structured logging to track mypy issues
- Updated docstring to mention mypy

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Standalone Mypy Tool**: Can run mypy checks independently via `run_mypy_check`
2. **Combined Checks**: Mypy is included in `run_all_checks` alongside pylint and pytest
3. **Flexible Configuration**: Supports all major mypy configuration options
4. **LLM-Optimized Output**: Results are formatted for easy LLM interpretation
5. **Consistent API**: Follows the same patterns as existing tools

## Files Modified

- `src/server.py`: 
  - Added import for mypy module
  - Added `_format_mypy_result` helper method
  - Added `run_mypy_check` tool method
  - Updated `run_all_checks` to include mypy

## Testing Verification

Created `test_mypy_integration.py` to verify:
- Mypy tool appears in MCP tools list
- Tool can be executed successfully
- Results are properly formatted
- Mypy is included in combined checks

## Integration Points

The mypy tool integrates seamlessly with:
- MCP server framework via `@self.mcp.tool()` decorator
- Logging infrastructure (both standard and structured)
- Existing code checking tools (pylint and pytest)
- Error handling patterns
- Result formatting conventions

## Next Steps

✅ Step 1: Core Module Implementation - COMPLETED
✅ Step 2: Server Integration - COMPLETED
⏳ Step 3: Testing and Polish - Ready to begin

The server integration is complete and functional. The mypy tool is now available as both a standalone tool and as part of the combined checks functionality.
