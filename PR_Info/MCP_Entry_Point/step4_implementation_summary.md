# Step 4 Implementation Summary - CLI Command Validation

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `src/config/validation.py`
- Added `validate_cli_command()` function to check CLI command availability
- Added `get_installation_instructions()` to provide helpful installation guidance
- Updated `validate_server_configuration()` to detect installation mode:
  - `cli_command`: CLI command installed and available
  - `python_module`: Package installed but no CLI command
  - `development`: Running from source files
  - `not_installed`: Not properly installed
- Returns installation mode in validation results

### 2. Enhanced `src/config/output.py`
- Updated `print_validation_results()` to display installation mode
- Shows appropriate status symbols for each mode
- Displays installation instructions when CLI command is not available
- Added support for "info" status in validation checks

## Key Features

### Installation Mode Detection
The validation now detects four different installation modes:
1. **CLI Command** (✓): Preferred mode with `mcp-code-checker` command available
2. **Python Module** (⚠): Package installed but CLI command not found
3. **Development Mode** (•): Running from source files
4. **Not Installed** (✗): Package not properly installed

### Smart Instructions
Provides context-aware installation instructions based on current mode:
- For not installed: Shows how to install from PyPI or source
- For python module: Shows how to reinstall to get CLI command
- For development: Shows how to install in editable mode

### Validation Integration
The CLI command check is integrated into the main validation flow:
- Checks if `mcp-code-checker` command exists in PATH
- Falls back to checking for Python module import
- Checks for source files in development mode
- Provides clear error messages and instructions

## Testing
The implementation can be tested in different scenarios:
1. With CLI command installed: `pip install -e .`
2. Without CLI command: Uninstall and reinstall without editable mode
3. Development mode: Run from source without installation
4. Not installed: Run in fresh environment

## Next Steps
This completes Step 4 of the MCP Entry Point implementation. The validation system now properly detects and reports the installation mode of the MCP Code Checker, providing helpful guidance to users based on their current setup.
