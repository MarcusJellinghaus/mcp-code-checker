# Step 1: Add CLI Entry Point to pyproject.toml âœ…

## Status: COMPLETE

This step has already been completed. The CLI entry point has been added to `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.scripts]
mcp-config = "src.config.main:main"
mcp-code-checker = "src.main:main"
```

## What This Does
- Creates a command-line executable `mcp-code-checker` when the package is installed
- Points to the `main()` function in `src/main.py`
- Available after running `pip install -e .` (development) or `pip install .` (production)

## Verification
After installation, users can verify the command is available:
```bash
# Check if command exists
which mcp-code-checker  # Unix/macOS
where mcp-code-checker  # Windows

# Test the command
mcp-code-checker --help
```

## Next Step
Proceed to Step 2 to update the config tool to detect and use this new command.
