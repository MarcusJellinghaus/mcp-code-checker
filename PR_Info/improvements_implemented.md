# Improvements Implemented

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Added Type Annotations to MockResult Class
**File:** `tests/test_code_checker_mypy/test_reporting.py`

**Before:**
```python
class MockResult:
    return_code = 1
    messages: list[MypyMessage] = []
    error = "Mypy not found in PATH"
```

**After:**
```python
class MockResult:
    return_code: int = 1
    messages: list[MypyMessage] = []
    error: str = "Mypy not found in PATH"
```

**Impact:** Improved type safety and consistency in test code.

### 2. ✅ Added Summary Statistics to Mypy Prompt Output
**File:** `src/code_checker_mypy/reporting.py`

**New Features Added:**
- Total issue count
- Breakdown by severity (errors, warnings, notes)
- Number of files affected
- Number of distinct error categories

**Example Output:**
```
Mypy found 4 type issues that need attention:

**Summary:**
- Total issues: 4
- Errors: 3
- Warnings: 1
- Files affected: 3
- Error categories: 4
```

**Benefits:**
- Quick overview of type checking results
- Better understanding of issue distribution
- Helps prioritize fixing efforts

---

### 3. ✅ Added Comprehensive Test Coverage
**File:** `tests/test_code_checker_mypy/test_reporting.py`

**New Test Added:**
- `test_create_mypy_prompt_summary_statistics()` - Verifies summary statistics are correctly calculated and displayed

**Updated Test:**
- `test_create_mypy_prompt_with_messages()` - Now also verifies summary statistics

---

### 4. ✅ Fixed Pylint Warning
**File:** `tests/test_code_checker_mypy/test_parsers.py`

**Fixed:** Unused variable `error` in `test_parse_mypy_json_output_malformed_json_object`
- Changed `error` to `_` to indicate the value is intentionally ignored

---

## Test Results

All tests passing successfully:
- ✅ 30 tests in test_code_checker_mypy/ - All passing
- ✅ No pylint errors or warnings
- ✅ Code follows project conventions

## Summary

The improvements enhance both code quality and user experience:

1. **Better Type Safety**: Added missing type annotations for consistency
2. **Improved Reporting**: Summary statistics provide quick insights into type checking results
3. **Maintained Quality**: All tests passing, no linting issues
4. **Follows Conventions**: Changes align with existing code patterns

The mypy integration is now more robust and provides better feedback to users about their type checking results.
