# Mypy Type Checking Fixes Summary

## Changes Made

This PR fixes all mypy type checking issues in the test files. The following changes were made:

### 1. Test Files Type Annotations
**Files Modified:**
- `tests/test_discovery_manual.py`
- `tests/test_config/test_discovery.py`

**Changes:**
- Added missing return type annotations (`-> None`) to all test functions
- Added type hints for Mock parameters in test methods that use `@patch` decorators
- Added return type annotations for pytest fixtures (`-> ServerConfig`)
- Added type hints for fixture parameters in test functions

### 2. Source Code Fix
**File Modified:**
- `src/config/discovery.py`

**Issue Fixed:**
- Removed unreachable code check for `isinstance(config.parameters, list)` 
- This check was redundant because after confirming `config` is a `ServerConfig` instance, mypy knows that `parameters` is always a list (due to the dataclass definition with `field(default_factory=list)`)

## Verification Results

All quality checks pass successfully:

1. **Pylint**: ✅ No issues found
2. **Pytest**: ✅ All 388 tests passed  
3. **Mypy**: ✅ No type errors found

## Type Safety Improvements

These changes improve type safety by:
- Ensuring all test functions have proper type annotations
- Making Mock parameters explicitly typed in patch decorators
- Removing redundant type checks that mypy correctly identified as unreachable
- Maintaining consistency with Python 3.11+ type hints syntax (using `dict`, `list`, `|` instead of typing module imports)

## Impact

- No functional changes to the code behavior
- Improved type checking compliance with mypy strict mode
- Better IDE support and code intelligence
- More maintainable and self-documenting test code
