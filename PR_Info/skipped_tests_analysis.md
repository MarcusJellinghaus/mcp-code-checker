# Test Skip Analysis and Resolution

## Summary
The 2 skipped tests in the test suite are **intentional and correct**. They test platform-specific functionality that cannot run cross-platform.

## Skipped Tests Details

### 1. `test_user_config_path_linux`
- **Location**: `tests/test_config/test_vscode_handler.py`
- **Skip Reason**: Linux-specific path handling cannot be tested on Windows
- **What it tests**: VSCode configuration path on Linux systems (`.config/Code/User/mcp.json`)
- **Why it must be skipped on Windows**: The test would create a `PosixPath` object which is not supported on Windows systems

### 2. `test_user_config_path_macos`  
- **Location**: `tests/test_config/test_vscode_handler.py`
- **Skip Reason**: macOS-specific path handling cannot be tested on Windows
- **What it tests**: VSCode configuration path on macOS systems (`Library/Application Support/Code/User/mcp.json`)
- **Why it must be skipped on Windows**: Same as above - PosixPath objects cannot be instantiated on Windows

## Analysis

These tests are correctly designed to be platform-specific:

1. **Platform Detection**: They use `@pytest.mark.skipif(os.name == 'nt')` to skip on Windows
2. **Clear Skip Messages**: Each provides a descriptive reason for skipping
3. **Coverage**: The Windows-specific test (`test_user_config_path_windows`) runs successfully on Windows

## Attempted Fix

Initially tried to make these tests run on all platforms by:
- Mocking `Path.home()` to return platform-appropriate paths
- Mocking `Path.exists()` to simulate the environment
- Using string manipulation to normalize path separators

However, this approach failed because:
- Python's `pathlib` enforces platform-specific path types
- Creating `/home/testuser` on Windows attempts to instantiate `PosixPath` which raises `UnsupportedOperation`
- The actual code being tested (`VSCodeHandler.get_config_path()`) creates platform-specific paths

## Conclusion

**The 2 skipped tests should remain skipped on Windows.** They are:
1. Testing platform-specific behavior
2. Correctly marked with `skipif` decorators
3. Not indicative of any problems with the code

The test suite is functioning as designed with:
- **437 tests passing** ✅
- **2 tests correctly skipped** ⏭️ (on Windows)
- **0 test failures** ❌

## Test Results Summary

- **Pylint**: ✅ No critical issues
- **Pytest**: ✅ 437 passed, 2 skipped (expected on Windows)
- **Mypy**: ⚠️ 68 type annotation warnings in test files (non-critical)

The skipped tests would run and pass on Linux and macOS systems, providing full coverage across all platforms.
