# Pytest Print Statement Output Investigation

## Issue
Question: Are print statements from unit tests visible to the MCP client when running pytest checks?

## Investigation Steps

### 1. Code Analysis
- Located pytest checking functionality in `src\mcp_code_checker\code_checker_pytest\runners.py`
- Examined subprocess execution in `src\mcp_code_checker\utils\subprocess_runner.py`
- Reviewed output formatting in `src\mcp_code_checker\code_checker_pytest\reporting.py`

### 2. Test Creation
- Created test file `tests\test_print_verification.py` with multiple print statements
- Included both passing and failing tests with various print outputs
- Used emojis and multi-line debug output to make print statements easily identifiable

### 3. Execution and Verification
- Ran `run_pytest_check` tool with `-s` and `--capture=no` flags
- Examined MCP client response for print statement visibility
- Verified output capture chain from subprocess to client response

## Key Findings

### ✅ Print Statements ARE Visible
Print statements from unit tests **are captured and visible** to the MCP client, specifically:

- **Failed tests**: Print output appears in the `longrepr` section of failure reports
- **Passed tests**: Print output not shown (standard pytest behavior)
- **Output includes**: All `print()` statements, debug messages, and stdout content

### Output Capture Chain
```
Unit Test print() → Pytest → JSON Report → subprocess_runner → MCP Client
```

### Example Output Captured
```
⚠️ Starting test_print_with_failure
This test will fail but should show print output
Multiple lines of debug output:
  - Line 1: Setting up test data
  - Line 2: Processing values
  - Line 3: About to make assertion
Value before assertion: 10
This line should appear in the test output!
```

## Technical Details

### Crucial Code Locations
- **`subprocess_runner.py`**: Captures all stdout/stderr from pytest execution
- **`runners.py`**: Executes pytest with JSON reporting
- **`reporting.py`**: Formats output including `longrepr` field containing print statements

### How It Works
1. Pytest captures print statements during test execution
2. JSON report includes print output in `longrepr` field for failed tests
3. Subprocess runner captures all pytest output
4. Reporting module formats the failure details including print statements
5. MCP client receives formatted response with visible print output

## Conclusion
**YES** - Print statements from unit tests are visible to the MCP client through the existing pytest checking functionality. The output appears in test failure reports when tests fail, making it useful for debugging test issues.
