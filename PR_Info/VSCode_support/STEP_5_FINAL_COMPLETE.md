## Summary

I have successfully completed Step 5 of the VSCode support implementation by updating all documentation to include VSCode support.

## What Was Done

### 1. Documentation Files Updated

#### README.md
- ✅ Updated overview to mention VSCode with GitHub Copilot
- ✅ Added comprehensive "Using with VSCode" section
  - Quick setup commands
  - Manual configuration instructions
  - Platform-specific paths for workspace and user configs
  - Requirements and setup instructions

#### docs/config/USER_GUIDE.md
- ✅ Updated Quick Start with VSCode examples
- ✅ Added `--client` option to all command documentation
- ✅ Documented client type aliases (vscode, vscode-workspace, vscode-user)
- ✅ Updated Configuration Storage section with VSCode paths
- ✅ Added VSCode-specific workflows:
  - VSCode Team Project workflow
  - VSCode Personal Setup
  - Multi-Client Setup

#### docs/config/TROUBLESHOOTING.md
- ✅ Added comprehensive VSCode Issues section covering:
  - Version requirements
  - GitHub Copilot setup
  - Configuration loading issues
  - Workspace vs User Profile guidance
  - Path resolution strategies
  - Multiple configuration handling

### 2. New Documentation Created

#### PR_Info/VSCode_support/VSCode_RELEASE_NOTES.md
- ✅ Complete release notes for VSCode support
- ✅ Feature descriptions
- ✅ Usage examples
- ✅ Requirements and migration guide
- ✅ No breaking changes noted

#### PR_Info/VSCode_support/VSCode_support_step5_documentation.md
- ✅ Step 5 implementation plan and details

#### PR_Info/VSCode_support/step5_documentation_complete.md
- ✅ Comprehensive completion summary

### 3. Quality Checks Passed

- ✅ **Pylint**: No errors or fatal issues
- ✅ **Pytest**: All 426 tests passing
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors with strict mode

## Key Features Documented

1. **Client Types**:
   - `claude` (default) - Claude Desktop
   - `vscode` / `vscode-workspace` - VSCode workspace configuration
   - `vscode-user` - VSCode user profile configuration

2. **Configuration Locations**:
   - Workspace: `.vscode/mcp.json` (shareable via git)
   - User Profile: Platform-specific locations documented for Windows, macOS, Linux

3. **Smart Features**:
   - Automatic package vs source detection
   - Relative paths for workspace configs
   - Absolute paths for user configs

## Documentation Principles Followed

- **Backward Compatibility**: Claude Desktop remains the default
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Quick start → detailed options → troubleshooting
- **Real-World Focus**: Team workflows, personal setup, multi-client scenarios
- **Platform Coverage**: All platform-specific paths documented

## Next Steps

The implementation is ready for Step 6 (Final Checklist and PR Preparation). All documentation has been updated, tested, and validated.

## Important Note

As requested in your guidelines, since code has been changed and edited, a new start would be required for the current LLM to use the code right away. The documentation updates are complete and ready for review.
