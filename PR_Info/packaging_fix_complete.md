# Packaging Fix Complete - Summary

## Problem Solved

The user encountered a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'` when running `mcp-code-checker` after installing with pip.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed pyproject.toml packaging configuration

**Before:**
```toml
[project.scripts]
mcp-config = "src.config.main:main"
mcp-code-checker = "src.main:main"

[tool.setuptools.packages.find]
where = ["src"]
include = ["*"]
```

**After:**
```toml
[project.scripts]
mcp-config = "config.main:main"
mcp-code-checker = "main:main"

[tool.setuptools]
package-dir = {"" = "src"}

[tool.setuptools.packages.find]
where = ["src"]
```

### 2. Updated test expectations

Fixed `tests/test_cli_command.py` to match the new entry point configuration:
- Updated assertion from `"src.main:main"` to `"main:main"`
- Added assertion for mcp-config entry point

## Technical Details

The fix implements the standard Python src-layout packaging pattern correctly:

1. **Package Directory Mapping**: `package-dir = {"" = "src"}` tells setuptools that the root package is located in the `src` directory
2. **Module Resolution**: Modules like `src/main.py` become importable as `main` (without the `src.` prefix)
3. **Console Script Generation**: Entry points now correctly reference the modules as they appear in the installed package
4. **Import Compatibility**: Existing relative imports continue to work unchanged

## Validation Results

All code quality checks pass:
- ✅ **Pylint**: No issues found
- ✅ **Pytest**: 448 tests passed, 4 skipped
- ✅ **Mypy**: No type errors found

## Next Steps for User

1. The user should reinstall the package:
   ```bash
   pip install --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/MarcusJellinghaus/mcp-code-checker.git@config_helper
   ```

2. Test the console commands:
   ```bash
   mcp-code-checker --help
   mcp-config --help
   ```

Both commands should now work without the `ModuleNotFoundError`.

## Impact

- **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to the source code
- **User Experience**: Console commands now work as expected after pip install
- **Development**: Maintains existing src-layout structure and import patterns
- **Testing**: All tests continue to pass with updated expectations

This fix resolves the packaging issue while maintaining code quality and project structure standards.
