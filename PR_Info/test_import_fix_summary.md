# Test Import Fix Summary

## Problem
The pytest test suite was failing with an import error:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'cli' from 'src.config.main'
```

The test file `tests/test_config/test_vscode_cli.py` was trying to import a `cli` object that didn't exist.

## Root Cause
The test file was written expecting a Click-based CLI interface with a `cli` object, but the actual implementation uses `argparse` with a `main()` function entry point.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Import Statement
Changed from:
```python
from src.config.main import cli
```
To:
```python
from src.config.main import main, create_main_parser
```

### 2. Updated Test Structure
- Replaced `click.testing.CliRunner` with direct `main()` calls
- Used `patch('sys.argv')` to simulate command-line arguments
- Used `StringIO` to capture stdout output when needed

### 3. Fixed CLI Flags
Corrected the VSCode workspace/user mode flags:
- Removed non-existent `--use-workspace` flag
- Changed `--no-use-workspace` to correct `--user` flag
- Understood that default behavior is workspace mode (no flag needed)

### 4. Enhanced Mocking Strategy
Added proper mocking for:
- Registry with server configurations including parameters
- All validation functions
- Python environment detection
- Client handlers

### 5. Created Helper Function
Added `create_mock_parameter()` helper to properly mock server parameters, ensuring the argument parser can accept the expected CLI arguments.

## Result
All 13 tests in `test_vscode_cli.py` now pass successfully. The tests properly validate:
- VSCode workspace configuration
- VSCode user profile configuration  
- List, remove, and validate commands for VSCode
- Client aliases (vscode, vscode-workspace, vscode-user)
- Dry-run mode
- Help text

## Notes
- One performance test in `test_vscode_performance.py` is flaky due to timing variance
- Some mypy type annotation warnings remain but don't affect functionality
- The fix ensures the tests properly mock all dependencies to avoid side effects
